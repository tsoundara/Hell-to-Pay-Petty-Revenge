## Hell to Pay: Petty Revenge


In Hell to Pay: Petty Revenge, you aren't fighting to save the world or topple a regime—you’re fighting because you’re annoyed.

While lounging at home, a breaking news report catches your eye: the city’s new, high-and-mighty Police Commissioner has launched a "Total Compliance" initiative. Translation? He’s handing out tickets for everything from jaywalking to breathing too loudly. Before the news segment even ends, a letter slides through your mail slot. It’s a $50 citation for "Existing with Intent to Loiter."

## The Mission: Make Them Regret the Paperwork
Most people would just pay the fine online and grumble. You? You’ve decided that the only appropriate response is a high-octane, neon-drenched trail of destruction.

The Goal: Fight your way through a city crawling with over-eager beat cops and bureaucratic enforcers.

The Motivation: Pure, unadulterated pettiness.

The End Game: Kick down the doors of the Commissioner’s penthouse office and deliver a physical "refund" for that ticket.
